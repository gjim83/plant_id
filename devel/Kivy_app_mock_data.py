# Thoughts/notes:
#
# 1. Maybe if there is no text/image/etc, don't have the field at all as opposed to an empty string?
# 2. If a question has "Other" as a possible answer, should matching plants either:
#    - Not have that property at all and the code matches plants without that property if that was the option that was chosen?
#    - Have that property explicitly set as "Other"?

# ======================================================================
# Mock data
# ======================================================================

# Notes about display:
#
# I'd like to keep a code-friendly ip for all parameters, but also have the ability to
# define a display format. The display can either be set explicitly with the ``display`` key, or
# can be inferred from the name by doing ``string.replace('_', ' ').title()``
#
# If a value is a string, display as is, if it's a list then ``', '.join(...)``

# Notes about tests with mock data:
#
# 1. If a user selects shape as "shrub", they should be taken directly to the 3rd option of the mock data below
#    because there are no further options possible (this wouldn't happen in the real version so early in the decision
#    process, but it may further down)
# 2. If a user selects shape as "tree", then they should get some feedback (maybe a quickly disappearing interstitial-like element?)
#    that gives them feedback about how many plants match what they have answered so far
# 3. In the same event as 2., for question 2 they should only get "simple-other" and "compound" as possible answers, as those are the only
#    two that are possible, along with a 3rd option "None of the above", which if chosen should display a message that there are no matching
#    plants. Same thing if they get to question 3, it should only display "entire", "serrate" and "None of the above" as potential answers,
#    even if there are more in the decision system.
